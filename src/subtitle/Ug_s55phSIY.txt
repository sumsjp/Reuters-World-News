I am very very happy I thank God that he
kept them safe the houses and the
destruction are not a problem the
important thing is that they stayed
alive thank God we will live in a tent
the important thing is that they are
alive separation is hard and the waiting
is harder my granddaughter was only 2
years old when she left maybe she's
forgotten me because there was no
internet or anything to communicate with
her I was waiting for 15 months to leave
the South my family my sisters my family
everything our houses are all here all
here in the north I regret the day I
left the north for the South I was
waiting to return night after night hour
by hour
